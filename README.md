# Stock-Analysis

## Project Overview

### The purpose of this project is refactor the code we worked on throughout the module. The code was written to mine through a large list of stock information and to output a concise display showing the total daily volume of a set of stocks as well as the return on them over a set period of time. 

## Results

## Results

### The advantages of refactoring code are clear in the length of time it took to deliver results. It is possible that with an even larger dataset that the refactored code would perform even better in comparison to the initial code that was written. 
### The code itself may have been slightly more complex, but if this was something that would be run often it would clearly be worth the extra time put into writing it.
